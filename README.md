Created a Tableau repository with interactive dashboards and visualizations to help analyze key business data. The repository makes it easy to explore and understand data through charts, graphs, and filters, helping users make informed decisions
Project 1: Created visualizations using the data set of Health Survey:

Some of the insights I had from this were:
*Highest blood pressures are mostly in European and African countries, but lower in western and eastern countries. 
* Lowest life expectancies are in African countries, whereas most of the rest of the world is much higher. 
* Higher BMIs tend to be in many of the “first world” countries, but lower in the majority of Africa and Asia. 
* Looking for health results based on BP , BMI and Cholesterol cases by country and gender wise
* Life Expectancy in each year by contient wise
* Cancer growth results in each year for both Men and Women
There is a positive correlation between the life expectancies for men and women, but some outliers show that this is now always the case, and, for example, women’s life expectancy is more than 10 years lower than men’s in Kazakhstan.

* Dashboard for different results:
Lowest life expectancies are in African countries, whereas most of the rest of the world is much higher.
